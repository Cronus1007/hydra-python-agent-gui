## Hydra Agent Console GUI

The React Frontend is divided in three main components.

- Hydra Console has the state for the whole component and its subcomponents are all controlled components.
- Hydra Graph only loads vis.js module and show what's returned by the ```/apidoc-graph``` endpoint
- App.js only has internally the fetched ApiDoc and controls the state of the views of maximizing/minimizing the Console.

The overall core structure of the Application is the following:
```
/app
    # This is the main component, declares <HydraConsole> and <HydraGraph>
    app.js 
/components
	# HydraConsole component and its Subcomponents
	/hydra-console
		/endpoints-buttons
		/operations-buttons
		/properties-editor
	# HydraGraph component
	/hydra-graph
```

### Contributing
There are multiple issues open to make the GUI better. When you make changes, make sure you run ```npm run build``` to create an updated production build for the Flask Backend.

## React Default Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.
By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json<br>

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
